# httpjson

A deceptively simple JSON REST HTTP client. üßê

Magically ‚ú® handles HTTP structured JSON requests with especially for backends
implemented in dynamic languages (python, ruby, nodejs, etc) that do not have
normalized structured response schema.

- Augments the standard library's implementation with upload compression üöÄ and
  add brotli and zstd decompression. The standard library only support
  decompression of gzip.
- Enforces no unknown response field.
- Exposes functions to gracefully handle fallback response schemas, e.g. in case of errors.
- Implemented with minimal dependencies.
